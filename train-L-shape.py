'''

This script collects the raw counts from the original Super Mario Bros. (SMB) and Super Mario Bros.: The Lost Levels (SMB2) levels 
and uses these to approximate the probability values of a Markov chain, which is saved to smbprobabilities.pickle.

This uses an L-shape Markov chain (right of Figure 6.7), where each tile value is assumed to be dependent on the tiles to the left, below, and to the 
left and below.
